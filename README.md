ello everyone, my name is Fabian and i am an mathematician-working-in-engineering from Berlin. I am currently working at the Chair of Flight Guidance and Air Transport at TU Berlin.
You'll mainly find me interested in everything related to discrete geometry, computational topology as well as optimization from a math persepctive and map matching, UAVs and the geometry of their swarms from an engineering standpoint.
Further i am interested in efficient workflows and tools.
